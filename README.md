### Technology Stack

The application is built on Laravel 11, leveraging a modern and efficient stack to deliver high performance and scalability.

- **Backend**:

  - **Laravel 11**: The latest version of the Laravel framework, used for building the application's backend and managing business logic.
  - **Laravel Sail**: A lightweight command-line interface for managing a Docker-based development environment without the need for configuring Docker manually.
  - **Filament 3**: powerful admin panel used to manage the application's content and resources, providing an intuitive interface for non-technical users to update and maintain the website.
  - **Livewire 3**: A reactive framework for creating dynamic, interactive components on the frontend without the need for complex JavaScript code. It allows for server-side rendering and state management, improving the user experience.
  - **PHP 8.3**: The primary programming language.
  - **MySQL 8.0**: A relational database for storing and retrieving application data.

### Integrations:

- **YooKassa**: A payment gateway integration for processing secure online payments.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the setup process for both development and production environments. Additionally, weâ€™ll provide a resource for setting up CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

### Prerequisites

- **PHP ^8.3**
- **Composer**
- **Node.js & npm**
- **Docker** (for Laravel Sail)

### Development Setup

To set up the development environment for the **AgronomProject** application, follow these steps:

#### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd [project_name]
   ```
2. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Install PHP and Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development environment with Laravel Sail**:
   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
   ```
5. Generate an application key and storage link:
   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan storage:link
   ```
6. Migrate the database and seed the database:
   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed
   ```
7. Build frontend assets:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
8. Create an admin user:

   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail artisan php artisan make:filament-user
   ```

9. Code style and linting using Laravel pint and Prettier:
   ```bash
   npm run style
   ```

At this point, the application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or a different port if using Sail).

PhpMyAdmin can be used to manage the database.
(http://localhost:8080)

### Production Setup

For deploying the application in a production environment, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your server;
- Set environment variables:

  Copy .env.example to .env, and modify the environment variables to match your production environment, especially database and payment system configurations.

- Install PHP and Node dependencies:
  ```bash
  composer install
  npm install
  ```
- Generate an application key and storage link:
  ```bash
  php artisan key:generate
  php artisan key:generate
  ```
- Run database migrations:
  ```bash
  php artisan migrate --force
  ```
